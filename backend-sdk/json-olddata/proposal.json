The event started with a formal introduction about Biotechnology association and its activities to the first year UG students. The event was held via Zoom cloud meetings. Initially, we had an introduction session about the PSG college of technology and the department of Biotechnology and then the students were separated into 5 and 6 membered groups through random group generators and there were subjected to different breakout rooms with a 3rd and 2nd senior students. This was majorly done to ensure a healthy interaction between the freshers and the senior students. In every breakout room series of connections, questions were posed to students based on random themes like Sports, Cinema, Politics, Albums, and also a few subjective questions from biology. A student who answers the question gets an advantage of directing a question to other members present in the breakout room.After the questionnaire session, students were given a series of hints for a story plot and they were encouraged to come up with innovative ideas. After an hour, a student from each group presented their ideas as story. Next, we had a short informal interactive session between  students. ",
