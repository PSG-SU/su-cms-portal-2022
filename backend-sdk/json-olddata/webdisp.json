At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized (subject to certain rules and regulations). ",
		"POSTDESC" : "The success of Technology, Entertainment, Design conferences led to the popular culture of independently (and privately) organised TED events or TEDx that are licensed by the TED organisation. The 2018 edition is the third installment of TEDxPSGTech and like its counterparts, it was an amalgamation of motivational talks by people from various walks of life. Without further ado, let me introduce the speakers and brief their interactions with the audience. <br />\r\nMalini Jeevarathnam, the first speaker of the day, is a human rights activist who is extremely passionate about her goal and focused towards it. She knows what the world needs and how a change can be brought about in the digital age. Having realised the power of mass media, she has also directed a short film that has been screened at about seven film festivals and has won several awards and accolades. <br />\r\nThe core of her talk was feminism – not the kind you need to stay in news but actual feminism. She spoke of how people find it demeaning to be associated with anything considered feminine and feminist and added that the reason feminism exists and will continue to, is to curb this sexism.<br />\r\nMr Vinay Bharadwaj and Mr Vijaya Lakshmi Narayanan – the duo are the young scientists in the seven-member team at Space Kidz who created a record by launching KalamSat, the world’s smallest (3.8cm x 3.8cm x 3.8 cm) satellite. Vinay is the structural engineer/ coder while Vijaya is an automation engineer and the lead coder of the team.<br />\r\nTheir talk was centered around how breakthrough ideas are born from small things. The idea for making a small satellite (KalamSat) was born while eating a gulab jamun. Vinay and Vijaya went on to explain the design, fabrication and coding involved in the making and its launch using a Near Space Launch Vehicle created by the team. The team is also venturing into blockchain currently.<br />\r\nMr Ashwath Mukunthan is a professional cricketer who has played a bunch of times for TN. He is well-known for his crucial five wicket haul in the TNPL (for his team), on his comeback after a five month long hiatus due to injury. Ashwath started off, talking about the decreasing physical activities (sports) amongst Indians and explained why the sporting culture is important for youth. He also spoke on why it is important to have an off-switch that could take you away from your routine for a while. He added that his off-switch was music and it only made him better in his sporting career. Ashwath quite took the audience by surprise with his natural skills as an orator and his singing skills.<br />\r\nThe story of Mr Nandakumar is quite inspirational. He was forced to drop out of school as he was identified as being dyslexic. However, it didn’t stop him; he finished his schooling privately and went on to become the Joint Commissioner of the Income Tax Department, Government of India. He spoke about how important it is to follow your heart, no matter how different your likes are or how others perceive them. <br />\r\nMs Maya S Krishnan is who you’d call a multi-faceted person – an engineer turned actress who is also into improv -comedy and storytelling and practices as a clown doctor (exhilarating much?). However, the turning point in her life was her experience with clown therapy which changed her perspective towards life. True to her profession, Ms Krishnan’s talk was centered around the theme ‘Laughter Heals’. Throughout her speech, she kept the audience engaged with her uninhibited antics and humor on stage.<br />\r\nThe final speaker of the day was Mr Karthik Kumar, an actor turned entrepreneur, stand up comic and storyteller who is, I’m assuming, pretty much the reason why a majority of the people got passes for the event. Kumar’s speech encompassed the idea of doing what you love. He emphasised that, in contrary to public opinion, it is okay to fail.  “Because no matter how many times you fail, even if it is a hundred times, it is still better than not trying or being in a place where you don’t belong”, he said. He also encouraged the young to try new things, citing his stints as an actor and entrepreneur (at Evam) as an example. It made so much sense because, as he said, it is better to be a jack of many trades, for everyone cannot be masters. <br />\r\n",

As English based exams like CAT and GRE are becoming very popular among the students, this event was very helpful in giving the students a glimpse of what they might face in such competitive exams. The several rounds tested the students’ mettle in basic grammar, comprehension and also in group discussions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAY 4 – TECHNO-THIRST<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTechno-Thirst was a purely technical event which had questions in core subjects of Electronics engineering. The preliminary round was an aptitude based and thus was a good training for students preparing for placement interviews. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAY 5 – 2.0<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2.0 was an event that tested the students’ presence of mind in urgent situations. It brought out their creative side and their presentation skills. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nDAY 6 <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe final round of Coderush was conducted on day 6.

Needless to say, the contestants were intelligence. courage and humour- all wrapped into wholesome packages.<br />\r\nA war of words. A clash of wits. A battle of reflexes. 'Marmalade', was a blend of the classic JAM game with a few twists. JAM (Just A Minute) is a popular contest in which participants must attempt to speak about a given topic in monotone, with no hesitation, repetition or deviation. Don't let this flimsy paper description fool you, for most participants don't make it past ten seconds before they are pounced on by hungry competitors. Marmalade certainly lived up to its cut-throat reputation. The riveting penultimate rounds paved the way for the brutal finals.<br />\r\n",

They are the ones who pay a lot for designing software. SAP is a leading enterprise company. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPOINT OF VIEW IS IMPORTANT:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to her, application of what we study in the class is very important.

She hires people who have a point of view and who know where to apply what they learn.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI):<br />\r\nAI transforms every aspect of what we do into a machine. AI is the science of making machine do things which are considered to be intelligent if it were done by us. Her passion is artificial intelligence because it discovers the unknown. SAP built an engine for transactions in a database. Taking huge volume of data and finding new patterns which humans have not discovered. AI should understand the needs of the customer and act accordingly. With proliferation of different types of data, and with the help of internet of things, we can monitor our home in Silicon Valley right from here. AI is taking advantage of machine to perform human task.<br />\r\n1. Planning,<br />\r\n2. Scheduling and<br />\r\n3. Optimization of the inventory is important for more profits.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEXPERT SYSTEMS:<br />\r\nShe gave a brief introduction about expert systems. In 1970’s expert system built rules in stock exchange to trade money which has transformed into software programming today which included complex algorithms and code. Expert systems will work only if we know the cause for the problem. Augmenting our capacity with AI we can make machine to find the cause for the problem. There are a lot of researches done on speech recognition like siri, Cortana etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDATA DESCRIPTIVE<br />\r\n- Batch Analysis<br />\r\nPREDICTIVE<br />\r\n- Iterative Analysis<br />\r\nPRESCRIPTIVE -<br />\r\nIterative Analysis<br />\r\nLEARNING<br />\r\n- Interactive Analysis<br />\r\nWe ourselves find hard to understand things but now we have to make machine understand things which is called NLP (Natural Language Processing).<br />\r\nShe asked the students to read about the NLP and study about the applications which are built on NLP.<br />\r\nDEEP LEARNING:<br />\r\nShe gave her views on deep learning.<br />\r\nDeep learning is the area where we use<br />\r\n▪ GPUs and not CPUs,<br />\r\n▪ neural networks,<br />\r\n▪ reinforcement technique,<br />\r\n▪ advanced learning,<br />\r\n▪ predictive analytics (Trying to predict what will happen in the next year where you have the data for some of the previous years). Encourages the students to have a look at several online resources on the above topics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCLASSIC PHASES OF WHAT WE DO WITH DATA:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWe enter some data and we generate a report which is conventional way. So the report is given only after things have happened. This is called DESCRIPTIVE Next, we need to know the report before things start<br />\r\nhappening – PREDICTIVE.<br />\r\nInstead of just telling that there is going to be a decline in sales the machine could tell us how to correct it – PRESCRIPTIVE. For example, using weather information to know how much umbrellas to store. Allowing the machine learn everything is called –COGNITIVE.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAI PATTERNS IN EXISTING MODELS:<br />\r\nSoftware programs that are written for AI or Machine learning is called models. These models are already available in huge.<br />\r\nBased on our activity we get our news feeds. With the knowledge of Twitter and other social media accounts we could predict the personality of the person. Every single day every one of us are using AI.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExamples are:<br />\r\n✓ Google email<br />\r\n✓ google translate<br />\r\n✓ Phone is a mini computer which uses tones of AI<br />\r\n✓ Alexa<br />\r\n✓ Siri<br />\r\n✓ Cortana<br />\r\n✓ Amazon is a power house of AI which uses AI for<br />\r\nproduct recommendations<br />\r\n✓ self-driving cars<br />\r\n✓ Facebook<br />\r\n✓ Pinterest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHOW IS AI DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING COMPUTER SYSTEMS?<br />\r\nWe are creating a model which is like human brain where we feed data and<br />\r\n▪ Allow the machine to understand<br />\r\n▪ Teach the machine to reason so that it can do things on its own next time and<br />\r\n▪ Constantly allow the machine to learn from it.<br />\r\nSo, the fundamental characteristics of AI could be<br />\r\n▪ UNDERSTAND<br />\r\n▪ REASON<br />\r\nCOMMON QUESTIONS:<br />\r\nShe addressed few common questions such as<br />\r\n1. How will ai take over the world?<br />\r\n2. Are we all going to be doomed?<br />\r\n3. Are they the terminators?<br />\r\nAnd gave an explanation stating all these cognitive systems cannot exist without humans. Because, without humans giving the inputs, training the systems, machines cannot do anything on their own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAPPLYING AI TO DIFFERENT SERVICES LIKE…<br />\r\n<br />\r\n▪ PUBLIC SAFETY - China has lots much of images across so if you want to lock a person down you can do it in some 15 minutes from any part of china.<br />\r\n▪ HEALTH CARE – There are two X ray images in which one has a defect. If the radiologist is unable to find the minute defect in it, we can apply AI which has the super nanoscopic capability to spot the difference and save a human’s life. To detect Cancer and correct it through Gene Mutation.<br />\r\n▪ In OIL AND GAS - When drilling underground the length must be very precise or it will cause a huge money. The precision is implemented with lots of sensors in image recognition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n▪ Image recognition in ENERGY AND UTILITIES to find pipe rupture in underground scenarios. She insisted in taking the deep services of AI and applying them in different business.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEXPERIENCE IN DESIGNING SMART CITY OF DUBAI:<br />\r\nBased on when the flights land and how the people move they wanted to move the bridges. That is the dream 2020 Dubai mission which was relying on technology to implement the above.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nINVESTMENTS OF COMPANIES:<br />\r\n▪ 66 percent in QUALITY CONTROL<br />\r\n▪ 62 percent PRODUCTION PLANNING – Myntra designs clothes based on what we need. It does not produce clothes and then tries to offer discount on them.<br />\r\n▪ 50 percent in MACHINE MAINTAINANCE – Spend money on tracking that machines are working properly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOTHER USECASES:<br />\r\nCHAT BOTS:  <br />\r\n▪ AI has transformed the way businesses function say chat bots. Autonomous agent tries to answer the FAQs. So that humans can concentrate more on the intellectual things<br />\r\n▪ Emphasized on students creating chat bots in Facebook by creating a dummy page.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAUTOMATION – Jobs which humans do are done by computers. AI has become a huge market of its own.<br />\r\n   Ethical biases must be taken care of, for every one of us contribute either consciously or unconsciously to the data that is open for research and analysis. Customer services are happening in twitter. She had represented the world economic forum in US for creating a fair AI society. Must have a passion for taking these technological capabilities and contribute to it to the degree that you are passionate about.<br />\r\n‘AI NEEDS YOU AND YOU NEED AI’    <br />\r\nQuantum computing accelerates AI which will be unbelievable say in the next 50yrs. It makes simulations in various fields within minutes She emphasized on thinking about the problem that needs to be solved may it be an Enterprise or consumer Software Though students have lots of opportunities they must give importance on having a point of view.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCONTRIBUTION FROM STUDENTS SIDE:<br />\r\n● Hackathon - embracing AI in area of interest<br />\r\n● Pursue Nano-degrees in course era or Udacity<br />\r\n● Follow social media, virtual forums <br />\r\n● Build GitHub profiles<br />\r\n● Give the open sources a try <br />\r\n● Individuals can gain credits by hosting projects.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nShe displayed some educational materials to explore on AI and asked to gain an insight on Industry solutions<br />\r\nAPI:<br />\r\nModels are given as APIs. She pictured 51 different APIs that are offered by IBM. For example – Sentinel analysis, Visual Recognition, trade-off analysis She also asked everyone to work on Node js. Supervised learning- both input and output variables are present and you have to use an algorithm to find the mapping. Unsupervised learning-you have only input data and no corresponding output data. She had worked on concepts of storing data into columns. AI amplifies what is already present.",

		"POSTDESC" : "The Following is the talk given by personnel from T.I.M.E Insititute:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThird year is the perfect year to prepare for GATE and CAT. Success is not a one-way path. Different people look at success in different way. He insisted on different opportunities that are available after BE so that the students can plan their career now onwards. As stated by him, managerial skills are way more necessary than technical skills for a good career which made Sundar Pichai very successful. An MBA from a top college yields very high salary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAn MBA from Bharathidasan University gives 11,00,000 per year salary whereas an IIM gives 1.5 lakhs per month. Our ability and skills play a major role for such a huge amount. MBA is the shortcut to a great career. He Displayed the top colleges for MBA in India such as<br />\r\nIIM Ahmedabad<br />\r\nIIM Calcutta<br />\r\nFaculty of Management Studies,<br />\r\nDelhi etc.<br />\r\nFMS<br />\r\nFMS has best return on investment. College fees for FMS will be 21,000 but the average salary will be 21,00,000. No college can provide such a salary.<br />\r\nIIFT<br />\r\nIIFT provides 1.5 dollars which is equivalent to 1 crore and most of the employments in New York, Hong Kong etc.<br />\r\nIIM<br />\r\nIIM Calcutta gives a highest salary of 75,00,000 and it provides a platform for improving our skills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTop B-schools in India always prefer engineers for them<br />\r\n Data intensive understanding,<br />\r\n Problem solving skills,<br />\r\n Mathematical abilities.<br />\r\nMajority of students studying MBA in top colleges are engineers whose career is guaranteed.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSubjects in MBA are<br />\r\n marketing<br />\r\n finance<br />\r\n human resources<br />\r\n system operational strategy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAll these are subjects are studied in the first year itself where there is nothing called department. All Subjects are common. In the second year<br />\r\nyou can choose department based on your choice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExams for MBA are CAT, SAT, SNAP, XAT.<br />\r\nThere are college specific exams such as IIFT.<br />\r\nExams test our<br />\r\n English ability,<br />\r\n Language ability,<br />\r\n Logical skills<br />\r\n Maths skills.<br />\r\n Thinking abilities<br />\r\nThe Session was made interactive by making the students to solve GATE and CAT problems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIIM Ahmedabad requires 99.8 percentile.<br />\r\nIIM Ahmedabad is the best B-school in India and 25 th best school in world. We have to work hard to reach such a place. If we go there our life becomes smooth. We have to be intelligent in a very basic level. Systematic preparation is what is required. A student from PSG tech has 27 arrears<br />\r\nhad written CAT and he is getting a 17,00,000 Arrears is problem in UG not in PG. A CGPA of 5 is enough for MBA. A student with 5.8 CGPA went to IIM Ahmedabad and with CAT score of 99.9%. If we are ready to work hard we can get it. They don’t look at your language skills but only our understanding abilities. Top iim offers 3-4% mark for females. Because of these gender diversities 50% girls and 50%<br />\r\n boys. before it was 90% boys. Every year nearly 4000 students go to IIMs. We need some time to prepare for CAT. This year the exam will be on November 25 th . We can write CAT from 4 th year onwards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMYTH AMONG STUDENTS:<br />\r\n “No money, no MBA”<br />\r\n “To get admission in good college student should have work experience”.<br />\r\nIt is comparatively difficult to prepare for exams and get admission in a good college while we are working than studying.<br />\r\nFor 4000 seats there are 2 lakh people competing. So we should be among the top scorers to get admission. All other exams also test for the same abilities.<br />\r\nCAT:<br />\r\nCAT is 3-hour test.<br />\r\nThere are 100 questions ,3 marks for each.<br />\r\nIt tests our<br />\r\n Vocabulary,<br />\r\n Reading comprehension,<br />\r\n Logical abilities,<br />\r\n Puzzle solving,<br />\r\n Mathematics (Geometry, LCM,<br />\r\nHCF).<br />\r\nEvery question asked in CAT will not be beyond 9 th and 10 th basics. A Calculator will be provided.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEvery year 13 to 14% students are declared as 100 percentiles in TIME which tells you the percentage of quality coaching. 60% students in IIM are from TIME. For 5 years in Coimbatore they had 1500 IIM calls.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3 rd year students are provided with 180 hrs of classroom training where they teach the basic of everything along with more than 200 video classes. So that we can revise all the topics later. This is the very comprehensive training program which trains us to get good results. Lots of handout sessions and exams will be conducted. When you write an exam you know where you stand. Classes will start at month of July till November 2019. Group discussions will also be conducted. Classes are conducted at these three locations<br />\r\n PSG SARVAJANA opposite to PSG tech<br />\r\n RANGAMMAL opposite to STANES school<br />\r\n Office at RS PURAM.<br />\r\nThis year, they are starting the classes in PSG TECH in J block Hall no 513 on 25 th of July during Mondays and Wednesdays. We can also attend a trial class and then decide whether to join or not.<br />\r\nGATE<br />\r\nIf you have a good GATE score you can apply to government job as well as private jobs in engineering fields. Competition is high in GATE where more than 8 lakh people attempt GATE.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGATE scores can be useful for<br />\r\n Tech jobs<br />\r\n Abroad studies<br />\r\n Semester exams<br />\r\n scholarships<br />\r\n MTech<br />\r\nHe displayed the companies that will recruit MTech from IITs.<br />\r\n60% score in GATE is equal to 90 percentiles for general category. We can get good admission only if we get 99 percentiles in GATE and this is very<br />\r\nhard. He showed some of the research centers like ISRO, which takes GATE scores into account.<br />\r\nGATE SPECIFICATIONS:<br />\r\n GATE has multiple choice questions.<br />\r\n 70% percent from core subjects, 15% from maths 15% from aptitude.<br />\r\n Negative marking is present.<br />\r\n 85% students who are writing GATE exam acquire just 25% marks.<br />\r\n GATE is a very tough exam.<br />\r\n Areas in computer science in which<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGATE has high focus are complier designs, operating systems and algorithms and data structures<br />\r\n 500 hours of intensive trainings which include both classroom trainings and tests.<br />\r\n Many exams will be conducted and lots of study materials will be given. Classes will go as per the college schedule and we make sure that we don’t miss any of the classes. There are two mobile applications, TIME for GATE and TIME for CAT which can be downloaded and used.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCONTACT INFORMATION:<br />\r\nT.I.M.E<br />\r\n1) A-102, Rajendra Center Near Hotel Residency Avinashi Road, Coimbatore.

It provides you with an opportunity to practice for an interview and receive feedback. A typical mock interview is a practice job interview held with a professional career counselor. A mock interview helps you learn how to answer difficult questions, develop interview strategies, improve your communication skills and reduce your stress before an actual job interview. During a mock interview, the interviewer may use a semi-structured interview format rather than asking a formal list of questions. The mock interview conducted by ECEA, held at PSG Tech, exclusively for final year ECE students, was interviewed by our alumni working at Bosch and other companies. They helped our final year students by training them to face the campus interview. They held two panels at different levels where the final year students were asked to come individually and to attend the mock interview. Each panel were examined by more than two alumni. The questions asked by the alumni were helpful for the final year students to face the campus interview with confidence. Initially, the questions were mostly from Analog Electronics, Digital Electronics and Embedded Systems which helped the final years to self-judge themselvesto know at which topic they want to concentrate more. Later the questions were asked analytically which could be faced by only few students. This helped them to learn more other than academics. They gave instructions about do’s and dont’s in a group discussion and then they conducted Group Discussion. In the group discussion round, the panel member examined how an individual is bold enough to express his views about the given particular topic and how he makes his views to reach others efficiently and also he examined how the students make use of the chance to reveal their unique talent from others. It also helped the students to develop ability to think when a topic is given on the spot. At last, HR interview was conducted for the final year students. It mainly focused on enhancing the management skills of the students. After all the process, this mock interview gave the final year students the confidence and enabled them to correct their mistakes. This process gave the final year students the fighting sprit, so which they could face any situation during the peak field of their placements. As an over view this mock interview went of quite amazing and enthusiastic.",

		"POSTDESC" : "Nanoscience is the design and fabrication of materials from the nanometer-length scale up to create novel and significantly improved devices and materials. In contrast, traditional materials science builds from large-scale objects down. The semiconductor industry, for example, has relied on developing smaller and smaller features in large silicon wafers to fabricate computer chips. In contrast, using a nanoscience approach, one can self-assemble chains of molecules to replace \r\nwires on conventional computer chips, and it allows the semiconductor industry to produce revolutionary computer chips that are not only smaller, but also faster and more powerful than anything that exists today. To put a nanometer-length scale into perspective, one nanometer—one billionth of a meter—is 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair. The building blocks in the biological world are nanometer-sized molecules such as proteins and sugars that, when \r\nassembled into intermediate length-scaled objects, deter- mine and control biological function. In addition to developing Nano electronics, many other features of the biosynthetic process \r\nlend themselves to devising Nano technological materials. To do its work, nature uses highly sophisticated processes, for example, selection; self-organization; and self- assembly to provide an enormous range of \"bio\"-materials that ultimately form cells, tissues and organs. These materials exhibit remarkable powers of memory, replication, self-healing and self-repair.",

		"POSTDESC" : "ABSTRACT:\r\nSemiconductors materials such as silicon (Si), germanium (Ge) and gallium arsenide (GaAs), have electrical properties somewhere in the middle, between those of a “conductor” and an “insulator”. They are not good conductors nor good insulators (hence their name “semi”-conductors). They have very few “free electrons” because their atoms are closely grouped together in a crystalline pattern called a “crystal lattice” but electrons are still able to flow, but only under special conditions.\r\nThe band gap represents the minimum energy difference between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band, However, the top of the valence band and the bottom \r\nof the conduction band are not generally at the same value of the electron momentum. In a direct band gap semiconductor, the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction band occur at the same value of momentum. In an indirect band gap semiconductor, the maximum energy of the valence band occurs at a different value of momentum to the minimum in the conduction band energy.\r\nTotal internal reflection, is complete reflection of a ray of light within a medium such as water or glass from the surrounding surfaces back into the medium. The phenomenon occurs if \r\nthe angle of incidence is greater than a certain limiting angle, called the critical angle. In general, total internal reflection takes place at the boundary between two transparent media when a ray of \r\nlight in a medium of higher index of refraction approaches the other medium at an angle of incidence greater than the critical angle. The use of a long strand of plastic (or other material such as glass) to pipe light from one end of the medium to the other is the basis for modern day use of optical fibres. Optical fibres are used in communication systems and micro-surgeries. Since total internal reflection takes place within the fibres, no incident energy is ever lost due to the \r\ntransmission of light across the boundary. The intensity of the signal remains constant.\r\nThe term nanoelectronics refers to the use of nanotechnology in electronic components. \r\nThese components are often only a few nanometres in size. However, the tinier electronic components become, the harder they are to manufacture.\r\nNanoelectronics covers a diverse set of devices and materials, with the common \r\ncharacteristic that they are so small that physical effects alter the materials properties on a nanoscale – inter-atomic interactions and quantum mechanical properties play a significant role \r\nin the workings of these devices. At the nanoscale, new phenomena take precedence over those that hold sway in the macro-world. Quantum effects such as tunneling and atomistic disorder \r\ndominate the characteristics of these nanoscale devices.\r\nThe Guest Lecture was attended by students pursuing B.E/B.Tech Programmes of various departments. As a token of gratitude, a memento was presented to the chief guest by Dr.M.D.Kannan, HoD, Dept of Physics.",

The invited speakers specialized in varied fields from photography, to stand-up comedy. The one-day event gathered an audience of students ranging from various departments, faculty, staff, and other personnel. \r\nThe first speaker to have graced the dais is Vaishnavi Balaji, a social worker. She is the head of Youth India, a Non- Profit organization which helps children in need of financial aid, to receive quality education. She spoke about the challenges faced in acquiring education to children, when the parents were themselves, struggling to make ends meet. Vaishnavi Balaji also spoke about the initiation of food banks, which collects leftover, but quite edible food from across the city, and delivers it to the hungry. The amazing woman is also in charge of Safe India, another NGO which helps with treatment, and care for children who went through abuse, and trauma. Her story left the audience in reflection, and inspired them to work towards bettering the nation, through small actions. \r\nThis was followed by Pranaadhika Sinha, a woman who has walked through fire, and made it strengthen her. An abuse survivor herself, she has helped over a million victims of violence, and abuse, gain a voice through a record- breaking campaign. She emphasized in her inspiring talk, the need for personal safety education, and awareness in India.\r\nJan Joseph George brought in interest for creativity with his talk about photography, and cinematography. He engaged the audience with a story about failing a mathematics paper, that led to his very unconventional journey into the field of multimedia. Listening to a celebrity photographer share insight on his artform helped fledgling photographers, and other form of artists in the audience the courage to pursue their own.\r\nThe most awaited talk of the event was probably from Manoj Prabakar, a stand- up comedian from Tamil Nadu. The audience found it surprising that a comic, a practiced stage performer, had issues regarding self- confidence. His talk was philosophical, but entertaining at the same time as he left lessons that lasted in the mind, while simultaneously bringing out easy laughs from the crowd.\r\nThe range of talks that took place in D Block Conference Hall that eventful day educated the crowd present, and made the audience think- which, in all essentiality, is the purport of a conference. Active thinking in itself is a step towards leadership in a fired neuron, and the Global Leaders Forum (GLF) made over a hundred student neurons fire that day by the end of The Summit.\r\n",

It helps to build confidence, and be spontaneous in taking appropriate actions in dangerous situations. Being in communities where women are looked upon as weaker sex, and where gender violence cases are rising, it is inevitable for women to learn self defence. Self defence techniques make one to fight, rather than freeze. Martial Arts Club and Women’s Development Cell jointly took the prerogative to spread the word of self defence among the tech girls. Trained masters accompanied MAC and WDC to make the event a great success. Initially, the possible attacks were discussed. For instance, choking the neck with the victim’s chain or shawl. Then the focus was turned to defence. The turns, twists and movements the victim has to take to escape different attacks were taught in detail. Then that the victim has defended, it gives an upper hand if the victim makes a counterattack. So, easy and effective counter attacks were taught to all the participants. For example, a hard blow at the solar plexus. Girls were also told how they could use their accessories or things in their handbags as weapons when there is a needful situation. With real time examples of situations and demonstrations, the event went so well. Students were taught to defend and attack and they were made to perform the same. On the whole, there was interaction and active participation from both the sides, i.e) the organisers, and the participants. It lasted for about two hours and the participants found it really useful.\r\n",

In today's busy world, the widely experienced and knowledgeable business person in industry spent his precious time to address the students. Faculty advisors of IIF, Dr. M. Sundaram delivered the Welcome address and Dr. P. Visalakshi delivered the Chief Guest address. With the active participation of the students, the session turned out to be very useful.",
		"POSTDESC" : "Mr. K P M Muthukumaran, being an entrepreneur, used many real-life examples and scenarios which made us think about the basic things that are happening in the society. He also gave some points on how to approach the problems in the world of business. The entrepreneur’s answers to the questions of the audience proved truly helpful to the gathered. Mr. Muthukumaran started his lecture by stating the differences between the situations of the past and the present. He explained that starting a bank account was a big challenge during his days, whereas today the banks call us every day. “Not taking risk is the biggest risk” was highlighted by him. He added that failures are a part of life and emphasized that one success will take over hundred failures. Being a master in his field, Mr. Muthukumaran started explaining the difference between job and business. When one understands the fact that scaling up is like addition in job and multiplication in business, one becomes a successful entrepreneur. He advised us to know a lot about our field, predict the future needs for the next 10 years and then start our business. The guest made us understand technology cost by taking steel as an example. Let us assume that we buy 1 kg steel for Rs.100 and sell 1 unit of steel for Rs.500. The added cost here is called technology cost. Emphasizing the growth in 3D printing, he encouraged the students to research on that. The speaker emphasized the importance of maximising customer satisfaction by introducing apps that can supply customised outfits. Investing in both technology and money is a smarter choice when compared to investing in only money. Investment companies depend on innovators to multiply their money, whereas innovators are independent. He also stated that women are the ones who carry out tasks without deviation while men need constant triggering.He also added that gender discrimination will not exist in future. Coming from an agricultural background, he explained how he earned the trust of his family members to invest in his new business. Using his personal experience, he asserted the significance of building confidence in one’s family about their skills. Mr. Muthukumaran took time to answer the questions of the students and helped them get a better vision about their future. It was an enthralling session that inspired the gathering to courageously take their first step towards their entrepreneurship journey. Finally, Yuvakiruthika P, the secretary of IIF delivered the vote of thanks to the honorable chief guest, IIF team and the participants. Team IIF presented a memento to the chief guest as a token of gratitude for gracing the occasion with his esteemed presence.",

The event consisted of three multifaceted rounds that tested the students on various capacities like aptitude, logical reasoning and soft skills. In this the number of participants participated is 68.",
		"POSTDESC" : "Round 1 (Tech- Q) was an aptitude quiz that put to test participants’ technical skills like logical reasoning, numerical reasoning, data interpretation etc. There was a total of 25 versatile questions with a mixture of easy, medium and hard questions. This round served as a very good platform to test the aptitude and analytical skills of the participants. The second round (Tech O Caza) was a treasure hunt. This was conducted across six different platforms namely SlideShare, Instagram, Google classroom, YouTube, Google forms and Google Meet. The questions tested their aptitude and critical reasoning skills. It was a high-stakes competition and only by giving the right answer, the participants could go to the successive questions. This round served as a good opportunity to test the time management and endurance of participants. The third round (Fake the philosophy) was a very challenging round where the participants were judged for their extempore speaking skills. The participants were asked to draw a lot consisting of either a hard or an easy topic. They were also given the choice to switch to an easier topic if they found a given topic too difficult. The topics consisted of various scientific and technical myths and misconceptions. Their task was to convince the jury that the given myth is the truth. The duration of the talk was about two minutes. This round helped them to relinquish their fears and become confident.

Major Dr. Kannan, Professor (CAS) and head of Physics department gave the chief guest address which was a highly inspiring and vigilance triggering talk. He elaborated on Lokpal bill and how Lokayuktha worked against corruption in different states of India, for instance in Punjab, MP, Karnataka. It was worth noting that only 17 states in India have Lokayuktha agency. Giving lots of examples, he expounded corruption levels in different countries. Singapore is a country which is almost corruption free.  He also insisted how every religion and our very own Deivapulavar.Thiruvalluvar is against covetousness or corruption. The different sinister forms of corruption were beautifully explained by him, which includes bribe, extortion, cronyism, nepotism, cartel, booth capturing, evading tax payments, illegal commissions, misuse of govt funds, misuse of police power and muscle power, and selling expired products. He used the time so nicely that he managed to give a large view on the prevalence of corruption in our country. He didn’t miss to mention how corruption affects the people who trigger corruption and their families. He also mentioned the aftermath of corrupted people getting caught.  Attendees pledged with all their spirit. That really instilled those thoughts of vigilance in everyone’s minds.\r\n",

This event was a fully fun filled one and which exposed their creativity mind. This event consists of three rounds. The three rounds are mentioned below,\r\nROUNDS:\r\nOn the hunt- In this round, a map was given with ten location points. First clue was given to the participant and they solved the further questions to get a new clue for further questions. This round was based on whoever decodes the question will move to the next question. This round consisted of 10 questions and the allotted time was 25 minutes to decode the 10 questions.\r\nSuit yourself in the situation- This round comprised of 5 questions in which each and every question was assigned with different situations, and the answer was how they tackle and handle that situation. Evaluation was based on how creatively they answered to that situational question. Maximum points were given to unique answers. The time allotted for this round was 10 minutes.\r\nStandby- Standby was a funny and interesting round which had 10 questions. Each question was assigned with different categories and the question was framed accordingly. The answer which satisfied both the category and given question was allotted marks. Main thing which was to be focused was time, that is 30 seconds were given for each question.\r\n      “This event was successfully conducted in virtual mode with the help of various online platforms and followed a proper grading system and winners were declared according to their best performance.”\r\nWINNERS :\r\n  01)RAKHUL MK – 20M434\r\n  02)SUBIKSHA M – 20X046\r\n  03)MOUNESH G – 20S018\r\n",

She also made a note that companies look for not only core technical skills but also few non-technical ones and most importantly confident and positive attitude. According to her, before making it into a particular company’s interview, it is essential to get prepared for the qualifications expected by that company. Prioritizing the tasks in an organised manner will take aspirants to their dream jobs, in her point of view.\r\n2.\tShruthi Chandrakumar (Final year-ECE G1) – Associate Consultant at Microsoft:\r\n She first worked as an intern at Microsoft and she was offered a Pre-Placement-Offer (PPO) at the end of her internship. For a software company, she considers aptitude, operating systems, database management and coding skills as the main attributes to be focussed. In her perspective, giving the best efforts will lead to success in the right time. Although managing both internship and placement preparation in the same period of time might initially seem difficult,with time everything sets perfectly. She believes that internships are vital in terms of placements, where it might even be a gateway, as well as for higher studies with an added advantage of working experiences.\r\n3.\tSaranya L (Final year-ECE G1) – Software Engineer at Fidelity Investments:\r\nShe was able to crack her placement interview in a short period of time as she had an appreciable hold on her core subjects that she had learnt for her semester exams and her hands on experience as an intern in the same firm in which she was placed. She urged that internships are often stepping stones to success if one wishes to get placed in the company where they are employed as intern. As placement training and internship works pile up at the same point of time, she implied that the start of placement preparations at the earliest will make the process easier.\r\n4.\tAbiga Sansuri M (Final year-ECE G1) – OFSSA Developer at Oracle:\r\nShe advised everyone to concentrate more on software than hardware, as our department will have high number of software companies interviewing. She also shared her biggest hurdle which was rejection and she told some points to overcome it. She notified that the companies look for an all-rounder who is good in every aspect of work. She suggested to attend all the interviews as possible because everything is a opportunities.\r\n5.\tSomalatha T (Final year-ECE G1) – Digital design Engineer at Texas Instruments:\r\nShe listed the top skills that the companies are looking for are real-time problem-solving skills and the attitude towards the company. She also suggested everyone to be strong in the technical part and read many general knowledge books. She also stated that its best to concentrate on both software and hardware.",

The participants were shortlisted for the second round depending on their scores. \r\nROUND 2 - RACK IT UP\r\nThe second round was divided into two parts, the first of which tested the competitors' spontaneity and presence of mind. The participants were asked five questions that were displayed on the screen in the first section of the game. The cups for building the castle were handled to the participants. They were provided five points for getting each cup by answering correctly, and two points were deducted if they answered incorrectly.The second partwas to assess the participants' soft skills. They were given a topic on the spot and  two minutes for preparation. Each teammate was expected to talk on the given topic for 100 seconds. They were judged based on their body language, spontaneity, relevancy, creativity and fluency.\r\n“Circuitronix” was the technical event of Voltz 2K22 conducted in online mode on 12th January, 2022. It consisted of 2 rounds that aimed at examining the core skills of blooming engineers.\r\nROUND 1 – CIRCUITZONE:\r\nCircuitronix's first round, 'Circuitzone,' was held in a google meet at 10 a.m. on January 12, 2022. The round was based on connections, with four sets of five questions each based on electronic circuits. The first four questions in each set explained the components of a specific circuit, while the fifth question defined the circuit itself. Each question was displayed for 45 seconds and they were required to write the appropriate answer in a google form that was submitted at the end of the round. The google forms were carefully assessed for accuracy, and eight teams were selected for the second round.\r\nROUND 2 – TECHNOCROSS:\r\nThe eight teams chosen for Round 2 were summoned to a Google meet. This round was split into two parts, the first of which was a JAM, in which teams were called at random and had to  choose a number from 1 to 8 that was displayed on the screen. After 30 seconds of preparation, the team had to speak for 1 minute on a specified topic based on the number they had picked. In the second round, each team was given a google document with a crossword puzzle grid including 15 questions that had to be answered in 15 minutes. On the basis of their performance in JAM and crossword puzzles, the teams were analyzed and graded. ",

At the end of the round, it was well-shown that the participants were completely satisfied with the responses they have given. Creativity is intelligence having fun. WORD HUNT was a good mix of technical and non-technical stuff. And it undoubtedly made the participants put on their thinking cap. This round was indeed very interactive and immersed all the participants in it. The participants enjoyed hunting for words a lot that at one point they wanted the round to never end. BINGO was a ground-breaking round, which made the participants get excited. This made the participant feel fascinating and also more competitive.
